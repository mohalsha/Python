Python Training:

On Day1, we leared about the different types of data in python, how to use them and how to change and check the type of a variable.

Then we started working on Arithmatic operaions, and on string formatting and concatenation.
Then we worked with lists, Dictinaries, and sets and ranges, and how to check Mutable and immutable types.

On Day 2, we started working with conditional and repitition statements. 
We also worked with functions and modules, Modules are a library of functions that you can call to use in your project without having to write the code agian.
They are basically a database of functions that you might want to call in your projects.
