Python Training:

On Day1, we leared about the different types of data in python, how to use them and how to change and check the type of a variable.

Then we started working on Arithmatic operaions, and on string formatting and concatenation.
Then we worked with lists, Dictinaries, and sets and ranges, and how to check Mutable and immutable types.
